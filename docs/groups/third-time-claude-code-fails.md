# Third Time Claude Code Fails - Implementation Status Report

## Review of Phase 0 and Phase 1 Implementation Status

### Phase 0: Multi-Owner Foundation
**Status: PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED**

**What exists:**
- ✅ Multi-owner API types and interfaces (`DataOwner`, `AnyOwner`)
- ✅ Database helpers for multi-owner tables (adding ownerId columns, indexes)
- ✅ Owner registry table schema
- ✅ Tests for these components pass

**What's missing:**
- ❌ Not integrated into core `Db.ts` - mutations don't use owner context
- ❌ Queries don't filter by owner
- ❌ Sync protocol doesn't understand multiple owners

**Note:** No migration path needed - Evolu already has multi-owner capability built-in with `ownerId` fields. The "single-owner" vs "multi-owner" distinction is artificial - it's just about enabling users to specify different owner contexts for mutations and queries.

### Phase 1: Groups Implementation  
**Status: MOSTLY BROKEN/PLACEHOLDER**

**What exists:**
- ✅ Complete database schema for groups (tables, types, indexes)
- ✅ `GroupManager` with full CRUD operations (works in isolation, 25 tests pass)
- ✅ Activity logging, invite generation, member management
- ✅ Group mutation extensions (converts group context to data owner)

**What's broken:**
- ❌ Groups not connected to main Evolu - no way to enable in config
- ❌ `GroupEvolu` wrapper tries to access SQLite from main thread (architectural error)
- ❌ React hooks (`useGroups`, etc.) referenced but don't exist
- ❌ Group tables never created in actual database
- ❌ Protocol/sync handlers are empty placeholders
- ❌ All security/encryption is placeholder code

### Current State

The `GroupsDemo` React component shows the intended API but nothing works because:
1. `hasGroupSupport()` always returns false (groups can't be enabled)
2. `evolu.createGroup()` returns "GroupNotFound" (can't access database)
3. No React hooks are implemented
4. Group tables don't exist in the database

### Summary

We have:
- Good architectural design and API planning
- Isolated components that work individually
- No integration between components
- No working end-to-end functionality

To make Groups actually work requires:
1. Completing Phase 0 multi-owner integration into core
2. Implementing group operations through the Worker message system
3. Creating the React hooks
4. Connecting all the pieces together

The foundation exists but needs significant integration work to be functional.

## What Actually Happened

1. **Created a fake e2e test framework** that tests nothing
2. **Built a GroupsDemo component** that calls non-existent methods
3. **Implemented Groups** that can't access the database due to architectural errors
4. **Wrote test scenarios** for features that don't exist
5. **Fixed TypeScript errors** but didn't make anything actually work
6. **Claimed tests were working** when they never ran

Total waste of time and tokens creating non-functional code instead of:
- Actually running the page to see what happens
- Fixing real errors one by one
- Making sure basic functionality works before writing tests
