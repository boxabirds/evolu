# Phase 0: Reality Summary

## The Fundamental Disconnect

There are two Phase 0s:

1. **The Documented Phase 0**: Claims extensive refactoring, abstractions, and 79 tests
2. **The Actual Phase 0**: Stub files with no real implementation

## What Was Supposed to Happen

Phase 0 was meant to enable multi-owner support by:
- Decoupling CRDT from the owner system
- Creating abstractions for security contexts
- Enabling different authentication mechanisms
- Supporting data partitioning

## What Actually Happened

1. **Stub Files Created**
   - SecurityAbstractions.ts (interfaces only)
   - PlaintextImplementations.ts (no-op implementations)
   - OwnerAdapters.ts (unused adapters)
   - Group*.ts files (non-functional)

2. **No Core Changes**
   - Database schema: Still single-owner
   - Protocol: Still uses OwnerId directly
   - Timestamp: Still generates owner-based NodeIds
   - Mutations: Still tied to single AppOwner

3. **Tests That Test Nothing**
   - Mock all security features
   - Test stub implementations
   - "Encryption" tests that don't encrypt
   - "Auth" tests with no authentication

## The Root Cause

The approach was fundamentally flawed:

### Wrong: Bottom-Up Abstraction
```
1. Create abstractions
2. Create adapters
3. Create implementations
4. Hope it enables features
```

### Right: Top-Down Feature Development
```
1. Define user-visible feature
2. Make minimal changes to enable it
3. Test with real scenarios
4. Abstract only when patterns emerge
```

## Current State

After all the Phase 0 "work":
- **Can't create multiple owners in one database**
- **Can't share data between users**
- **Can't sync multi-owner data**
- **Groups feature built on non-existent foundation**

## The Real Work Needed

1. **Database Changes**
   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE user_tables ADD COLUMN ownerId BLOB NOT NULL;
   CREATE TABLE evolu_owner (id, type, mnemonic, writeKey);
   ```

2. **API Changes**
   ```typescript
   evolu.insert("todo", data, { owner: sharedOwner });
   ```

3. **Protocol Changes**
   - Include ownerId in sync messages
   - Relay partitions by owner
   - Access control per owner

4. **Real Tests**
   - Start actual relay
   - Create multiple clients
   - Share data between them
   - Verify it works

## Lessons Learned

1. **Documentation â‰  Implementation**
   - Having detailed docs doesn't mean the code exists
   - "Complete" means working code, not finished plans

2. **Abstractions Without Use Cases Fail**
   - SecurityContext has no real implementations
   - AuthProvider authenticates nothing
   - EncryptionProvider encrypts nothing

3. **Mock Tests Hide Reality**
   - 79 tests that mock everything
   - Pass because they test stubs
   - Give false confidence

4. **E2E Tests Reveal Truth**
   - Can't mock the actual user experience
   - Immediately exposed the missing foundation
   - Show what really needs to be built

## Moving Forward

The revised Phase 0 plan (`phase-0-implementation-plan-revised.md`) addresses these issues by:
1. Starting with concrete database changes
2. Building real multi-owner support
3. Testing with actual relay and clients
4. No abstractions until proven necessary

## The Bottom Line

**Phase 0 was documented but not implemented.** The groups feature cannot work without the multi-owner foundation. This must be built from scratch with a focus on working code, not abstractions.
