# Phase 0: Refactoring - The Reality Check

## What Was Supposed to Happen

The original Phase 0 plan was to "decouple CRDT from the owner system" by introducing abstractions like:
- SecurityContext
- AuthProvider 
- PartitionStrategy

This would supposedly make it easy to add groups by just implementing these interfaces.

## What Actually Happened

**Nothing.** 

The Phase 0 refactoring was never actually implemented. Instead:

1. **Stub files were created** with empty implementations
2. **Tests were written** that mock everything
3. **The fundamental architecture wasn't changed** at all

## Why The Original Plan Failed

The original plan had several fatal flaws:

### 1. Over-Engineering
Creating abstractions before understanding the concrete requirements led to:
- Interfaces that don't match real needs
- Abstractions that leak implementation details
- More complexity without solving the core problem

### 2. Wrong Problem Focus
The real problem isn't "CRDT is coupled to owners" - the real problem is:
- **Evolu only supports one owner per database**
- **The database schema doesn't support multiple owners**
- **The sync protocol only handles single owner**

### 3. Bottom-Up Instead of Top-Down
The plan tried to refactor internals hoping it would enable features. Instead, we should:
- Start with the user-facing feature (multiple owners)
- Build the minimal implementation that works
- Only abstract when there's a clear need

## The Actual State of the Code

### What Exists
```
packages/common/src/Evolu/
├── GroupTypes.ts              # Type definitions (no implementation)
├── GroupManager.ts            # Stub that doesn't work
├── GroupInvite.ts            # Depends on non-existent features
├── GroupAPI.ts               # Interface with no real implementation
├── GroupEvolu.ts             # Wrapper that does nothing
├── GroupProtocolHandler.ts   # Confused about what ProtocolMessage is
├── GroupSecurityContext.ts   # Implements non-existent interface
└── ... (more stubs)
```

### What's Missing
- Multi-owner database support
- Owner column in user tables
- Multi-owner sync protocol
- Relay support for multiple owners
- Any actual working functionality

## The Real Phase 0 Requirements

Based on trying to run e2e tests, here's what Phase 0 actually needs:

### 1. Database Changes
```sql
-- Add owner support to ALL user tables
ALTER TABLE user_table ADD COLUMN ownerId BLOB NOT NULL;

-- Track all owners in the database
CREATE TABLE evolu_owner (
  id BLOB PRIMARY KEY,
  type TEXT NOT NULL,
  mnemonic TEXT,  -- Encrypted with app owner key
  writeKey BLOB,
  createdAt TEXT NOT NULL
);
```

### 2. API Changes
```typescript
// Current: Single owner implicit
evolu.insert("todo", { title: "Hello" });

// Needed: Multi-owner explicit
evolu.insert("todo", { title: "Hello" }, { owner: sharedOwner });
```

### 3. Sync Protocol Changes
- Messages must include owner ID
- Relay must partition by owner
- Clients must handle multiple owner subscriptions

### 4. Real Tests
Not unit tests with mocks, but integration tests that:
- Start a real relay
- Create multiple clients
- Share data between them
- Verify isolation and access control

## Lessons Learned

1. **Don't build abstractions without concrete use cases**
2. **Don't write tests that mock the thing being tested**
3. **Start with end-to-end scenarios and work backwards**
4. **If you can't demo it, it doesn't work**

## Moving Forward

The revised Phase 0 plan (phase-0-implementation-plan-revised.md) addresses these issues by:
- Starting with concrete database changes
- Building real multi-owner support
- Testing with actual relay and clients
- No abstractions until proven necessary
