# Phase 0, Step 3: Protocol Refactoring Progress

## Overview

This document tracks the progress of refactoring the Protocol module to use AuthProvider instead of WriteKey, as part of the broader effort to decouple CRDT from the owner system.

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Security Abstractions Layer ✅
- Created `SecurityAbstractions.ts` with core interfaces:
  - `SecurityContext`: Abstraction for security contexts (owner, group, plaintext)
  - `AuthProvider`: Authentication proof creation and verification
  - `EncryptionProvider`: Data encryption/decryption
  - `PartitionStrategy`: Data partitioning and sync decisions
  - `SecurityFactory`: Factory for creating security components

### 2. Plaintext Implementations ✅
- Created `PlaintextImplementations.ts` for testing:
  - `PlaintextSecurityContext`: No-op security context
  - `PlaintextAuthProvider`: No-op authentication
  - `PlaintextEncryptionProvider`: Pass-through encryption
  - `PlaintextPartitionStrategy`: Allow-all sync strategy

### 3. Owner Adapters ✅
- Created `OwnerAdapters.ts` to bridge existing system:
  - `OwnerSecurityContext`: Adapts Owner to SecurityContext
  - `OwnerAuthProvider`: Adapts WriteKey to AuthProvider
  - `OwnerEncryptionProvider`: Uses existing SymmetricCrypto
  - `OwnerPartitionStrategy`: Implements owner-based partitioning
  - Handles both Owner and SharedOwner types

### 4. Protocol Abstractions ✅
- Created `ProtocolAbstractions.ts` for protocol-specific needs:
  - `Storage` interface extension with auth support
  - `ProtocolAuthAdapter`: Bridges WriteKey and AuthProvider
  - `AuthMode`: Replaces WriteKeyMode
  - Helper functions for compatibility

### 5. Protocol Module Updates ✅
- Added auth-based functions to `Protocol.ts`:
  - `createProtocolMessageBufferWithAuth`: Uses AuthProvider
  - `createProtocolMessageFromCrdtMessagesWithAuth`: CRDT messages with auth
  - `parseProtocolMessageWithAuth`: Placeholder for auth-based parsing
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing WriteKey system

## Current State

The foundation for Protocol refactoring is in place:
- All abstractions are defined and tested
- Adapter pattern allows gradual migration
- Existing functionality remains unchanged
- Tests are passing and build is successful

## Next Steps

### Immediate Tasks
1. **Complete Protocol Auth Implementation**
   - Implement full auth-based message parsing
   - Update protocol buffer encoding for AuthProof
   - Add auth rotation support

2. **Update Storage Interface**
   - Implement `validateAuthProof` in actual storage
   - Implement `setAuthMaterial` for auth persistence
   - Create migration path for existing WriteKey data

3. **Integration Testing**
   - Test auth-based protocol with real data
   - Verify backward compatibility
   - Performance testing

### Future Work
- Phase 0, Step 4: Refactor Sync to use PartitionStrategy
- Phase 0, Step 5: Update CRDT Engine to use abstractions
- Phase 1: Implement group-based security

## Technical Decisions

### 1. Adapter Pattern
Used adapter pattern to maintain compatibility:
- `ProtocolAuthAdapter` wraps both old and new auth systems
- Allows gradual migration without breaking changes
- Can be removed once migration is complete

### 2. Auth Proof Structure
```typescript
interface AuthProof {
  type: string;  // "owner-writekey", "signature", etc.
  data: BinaryData;
}
```
- Flexible type system for different auth methods
- Binary data for efficiency
- Extensible for future auth types

### 3. Backward Compatibility
- New functions alongside existing ones
- Legacy WriteKey support in adapters
- No changes to existing protocol wire format (yet)

## Testing Strategy

1. **Unit Tests**: All new abstractions have comprehensive tests
2. **Integration Tests**: Protocol tests still pass with no changes
3. **Migration Tests**: Need to add tests for gradual migration scenarios

## Risks and Mitigations

1. **Risk**: Protocol wire format changes
   - **Mitigation**: Keep WriteKey encoding for now, add AuthProof as extension

2. **Risk**: Performance impact from abstraction
   - **Mitigation**: Measure performance, optimize hot paths

3. **Risk**: Breaking existing clients
   - **Mitigation**: Strict backward compatibility, version negotiation

## Code Metrics

- Files added: 7
- Files modified: 1 (Protocol.ts)
- Tests added: 51
- All tests passing: ✅
- Build successful: ✅

## Summary

Phase 0, Step 3 has established the groundwork for refactoring the Protocol module. The abstraction layer is in place, adapters provide compatibility, and the path forward is clear. The next phase will involve implementing the full auth-based protocol while maintaining backward compatibility.
