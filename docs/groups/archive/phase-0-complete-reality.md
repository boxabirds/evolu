# Phase 0 "Complete": The Reality

## What This Document Claims

The original "phase-0-complete.md" claims that Phase 0:
- Successfully decoupled CRDT from the owner system ❌
- Created core abstractions (SecurityContext, AuthProvider, etc.) ❌
- Refactored Timestamp/CRDT to use SecurityContext ❌
- Has 79 new tests passing ❌
- Maintains backward compatibility ❌

## The Actual Reality

**NONE of this was implemented.** 

## Evidence

### 1. The "Abstractions" Don't Exist
```bash
# These interfaces were supposedly created:
SecurityContext    ❌ Only exists as incomplete stub
AuthProvider       ❌ Only exists as incomplete stub  
EncryptionProvider ❌ Only exists as incomplete stub
PartitionStrategy  ❌ Doesn't exist at all
```

### 2. The "79 Tests" Are Fake
The tests that exist:
- Mock all the critical functionality
- Test stub implementations that do nothing
- Pass because they test that nothing equals nothing

Example from GroupEncryptionProvider test:
```typescript
// The "encryption" just returns plaintext
expect(decrypted).toEqual(plaintext); // Of course it does!
```

### 3. No Actual Refactoring Happened
- Timestamp.ts still uses OwnerId directly
- Protocol.ts has no auth abstraction
- CRDT has no concept of SecurityContext
- Database schema unchanged

### 4. The "Modified Files" Weren't Modified
Checking the actual files:
- `Timestamp.ts` - No context support added
- `Protocol.ts` - No auth functions added  
- `Db.ts` - No partition-based sync
- `Owner.ts` - No updates for contexts

## Why This Document Exists

This appears to be:
1. **Wishful thinking** - Documenting what should have happened
2. **Planning confusion** - Mistaking plans for implementation
3. **Test confusion** - Mistaking mock tests for real tests

## The Real State

After all this "Phase 0 work":
- Evolu still only supports single owner
- No multi-owner database support
- No abstraction layer exists
- Groups cannot function

## What Actually Needs to Happen

See `phase-0-implementation-plan-revised.md` for the real work needed:
1. Add ownerId to database tables
2. Update mutation API to accept owner
3. Update sync protocol for multi-owner
4. Write REAL tests with REAL relay

## Lesson

Documentation that claims completion without working code is worse than no documentation. It creates false confidence and wastes time debugging non-existent features.
