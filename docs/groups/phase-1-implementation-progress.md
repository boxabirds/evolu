# Phase 1 Implementation Progress

## ❌ Feature 1: Group Security Foundation - NOT IMPLEMENTED

### Reality Check

**None of these files exist.** This feature has not been implemented at all.

### Missing Files

1. **GroupSecurityContext.ts** - Does not exist
2. **GroupAuthProvider.ts** - Does not exist
3. **EpochManager.ts** - Does not exist
4. **GroupEncryptionProvider.ts** - Does not exist

### Why This Is Critical

- These components form the foundation for all group functionality
- Without them, groups cannot have separate security contexts
- Phase 0 security abstractions (which these would implement) also don't exist
- No tests exist for these components

## ❌ Feature 2: Storage & Schema Extensions - NOT IMPLEMENTED

### Reality Check

**No database extensions have been made.** The schema remains unchanged.

### Missing Implementation

1. **GroupSchema.ts** - Does not exist
2. **GroupDbInit.ts** - Does not exist  
3. **GroupConfig.ts** - Does not exist
4. No group tables in the database
5. No schema modifications

### Evidence

- The `enableGroups: true` config option causes TypeScript errors
- No group-related tables exist in SQLite
- Database schema is unchanged from pre-group design

## ❌ Feature 3: Protocol & Message Handling - NOT IMPLEMENTED

### Reality Check

**No protocol extensions have been made.** The sync protocol is unchanged.

### Missing Implementation

1. **GroupProtocolMessage.ts** - Does not exist
2. **GroupProtocolHandler.ts** - Does not exist
3. **GroupSyncHandler.ts** - Does not exist
4. **GroupDbExtensions.ts** - Does not exist

### Evidence

- The relay server has no group support
- Protocol messages don't include group fields
- No message routing based on groups
- Sync continues to work only for single-owner model

## ❌ Feature 4: Group Management - NOT IMPLEMENTED

### Reality Check

**No group management exists.** Cannot create, join, or manage groups.

### Missing Implementation

1. **GroupManager.ts** - Does not exist
2. **GroupInvite.ts** - Does not exist

### Evidence

- No methods to create groups
- No invite system
- No member management
- Mock implementations were created for demos because this doesn't exist

## ❌ Feature 5: API Extensions - NOT IMPLEMENTED

### Reality Check

**No API extensions exist.** The Evolu API has no group methods.

### Missing Implementation

1. **GroupAPI.ts** - Empty file (0 bytes)
2. **GroupEvolu.ts** - Does not exist
3. **GroupMutationExtensions.ts** - Does not exist

### Evidence

- `hasGroupSupport(evolu)` returns false (when it exists)
- No group methods on evolu instance
- Cannot create, join, or manage groups through the API
- This is why mock implementations were needed

## ⚠️ Feature 6: Platform Integration - PARTIALLY ATTEMPTED

### What Was Actually Done

**Files were created but they don't work** because the core functionality doesn't exist.

### Files Created

1. **React Hooks** (`packages/react/src/`)
   - `useCurrentGroup.ts` ✅ Created
   - `useGroups.ts` ✅ Created
   - `useGroup.ts` ✅ Created
   - `useGroupMembers.ts` ✅ Created
   - Updated exports in `index.ts` ✅

2. **Svelte Stores** (`packages/svelte/src/lib/`)
   - `groups.svelte.ts` ✅ Created
   - Updated exports in `index.svelte.ts` ✅

3. **TypeScript Exports** (`packages/common/src/Evolu/Public.ts`)
   - Added group type exports ✅

### Why They Don't Work

- All hooks/stores import types that don't exist
- They call methods on evolu that don't exist
- TypeScript build fails with these files
- `hasGroupSupport` is exported but always returns false
- This is why mock implementations were needed for demos

### Evidence

- Build errors when trying to compile
- Had to create `GroupsDemoMock.tsx` instead of using real hooks
- E2E tests use mock implementations, not the actual hooks/stores

## ❌ Feature 7: Documentation - NOT STARTED

### Next Steps

Ready to implement:
- API documentation for all new methods
- Getting started guide for groups
- Architecture documentation

## Summary

**Actual Status: 0/7 Features Complete**
- ❌ Group Security Foundation - Not implemented
- ❌ Storage & Schema Extensions - Not implemented
- ❌ Protocol & Message Handling - Not implemented
- ❌ Group Management - Not implemented
- ❌ API Extensions - Not implemented
- ⚠️ Platform Integration - Files created but non-functional
- ❌ Documentation - Not started

**What Actually Exists:**
- Empty or stub files in React and Svelte packages
- Mock implementations for E2E testing demos
- Playwright tests that test the mocks, not real functionality
- Updated TypeScript exports that reference non-existent types

**Critical Issue:**
- Phase 0 (Security Abstractions) was never implemented
- Without Phase 0, Phase 1 cannot be properly built
- Attempted to build Feature 6 without Features 1-5

**Next Steps:**
1. Implement Phase 0 security abstractions first
2. Then implement Phase 1 features in order (1→2→3→4→5→6→7)
3. Don't skip to platform integration without the foundation
