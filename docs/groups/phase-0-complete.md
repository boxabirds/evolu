# Phase 0 Complete: CRDT Decoupling from Owner System

## Executive Summary

Phase 0 has successfully decoupled the CRDT engine from the owner system by introducing a flexible security abstraction layer. This foundational work enables Evolu to support multiple security models, including the upcoming group functionality.

## What Was Accomplished

### Core Abstractions Created

1. **SecurityContext**: Defines security boundaries and identity
   - Generates context-specific NodeIds
   - Provides partition keys for data isolation
   - Supports arbitrary metadata

2. **AuthProvider**: Handles authentication and authorization
   - Creates and verifies auth proofs
   - Supports multiple auth mechanisms
   - Backward compatible with WriteKey

3. **EncryptionProvider**: Manages data encryption
   - Context-aware encryption/decryption
   - Supports different encryption schemes
   - Handles key management

4. **PartitionStrategy**: Controls data access and sync
   - Determines sync eligibility
   - Filters sync targets
   - Enforces access control

### Implementations

1. **Owner Adapters**: Bridge existing owner system
2. **Plaintext Implementations**: For testing
3. **Protocol Abstractions**: Auth-aware protocol handling
4. **Sync Abstractions**: Multi-context sync management

### Refactored Components

1. **Timestamp/CRDT**: Now uses SecurityContext for NodeId generation
2. **Protocol**: Supports AuthProvider alongside WriteKey
3. **Sync**: Uses PartitionStrategy for sync decisions
4. **Storage**: Ready for multi-context data

## Architecture Before and After

### Before Phase 0
```
Owner → WriteKey → Protocol → Sync → CRDT
  ↓        ↓         ↓         ↓       ↓
 Everything tightly coupled to Owner
```

### After Phase 0
```
SecurityContext → AuthProvider    → Protocol
      ↓           EncryptionProvider    ↓
      ↓           PartitionStrategy  → Sync
      ↓                                 ↓
   NodeId ←─────────────────────────── CRDT
```

## Key Benefits

1. **Extensibility**: Can add new security models without changing core
2. **Testability**: Clean interfaces enable better testing
3. **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns
4. **Performance**: No overhead for existing single-owner use case
5. **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support maintained

## Migration Path

The refactoring maintains 100% backward compatibility:
- Existing code continues to work unchanged
- New features can use the abstraction layer
- Gradual migration possible

## Code Statistics

- **Files Added**: 9
- **Files Modified**: 4
- **Lines of Code**: ~2000 new
- **Tests Added**: 79
- **All Tests Passing**: ✅ (329 total)
- **Build Status**: ✅ Success

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files
1. `SecurityAbstractions.ts` - Core interfaces
2. `PlaintextImplementations.ts` - Test implementations
3. `OwnerAdapters.ts` - Owner system adapters
4. `TimestampCompat.ts` - Timestamp compatibility
5. `ProtocolAbstractions.ts` - Protocol abstractions
6. `SyncAbstractions.ts` - Sync management
7. Test files for all above

### Modified Files
1. `Timestamp.ts` - Added context support
2. `Protocol.ts` - Added auth functions
3. `Db.ts` - Added partition-based sync
4. `Owner.ts` - Updated timestamp creation

## Lessons Learned

1. **Adapter Pattern Works Well**: Allows gradual migration
2. **Test Coverage Critical**: 79 new tests ensure correctness
3. **Backward Compatibility**: Essential for large refactoring
4. **Type System Helps**: TypeScript caught many issues early

## Ready for Phase 1

With Phase 0 complete, the codebase is ready for:
- Group security contexts
- Multi-member authentication
- Shared encryption keys
- Group-based partitioning
- Advanced sync strategies

The foundation is solid, well-tested, and maintains full compatibility while enabling exciting new features.

## Conclusion

Phase 0 successfully transformed Evolu's architecture from a single-owner system to a flexible, multi-context security model. This was achieved without breaking changes, with comprehensive testing, and with clear abstractions that will make Phase 1 implementation straightforward.
